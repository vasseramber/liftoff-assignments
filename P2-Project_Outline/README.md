### Overview
Color me good is a make-up matching system that chooses the best color for your skin tone. I've relized that most people have to still use multiple foundations to mix to get a color that matches their skin tone and most of the time it is not always a perfect match. I have made a program that has compiled skin tones of multiple people and every foundation available to perfectly match each skin tone with the foundations available. This will put an end to buying multiple foundations and/or buying the wrong foundation for your skin tone.
